Grape Buildout
==============

This buildout configures Grape pipelines, used for processing 
and analyzing RNA-Seq data.

    * Download it from the `Grape Homepage <http://big.crg.cat/services/grape>`_

To install it, check out the installation instructions:

    * :ref:`installation`

You have two options to evaluate Grape, one for a predefined dataset, and one for
the case that you have a dataset for one of the species we provide genomes 
and annotations for.
    
    * :ref:`test_pipeline_run`

    * :ref:`quick_pipeline_run`

In order to take full advantage of Grape, you need to learn how to configure 
and run it for all your RNA-Seq datasets.

    * :ref:`custom_pipeline_run`

The next step is to visualize the results in a web browser and share your results
using the Raisin web server:

    * :ref:`run_raisin_web_server`
