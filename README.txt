Grape RNAseq Analysis Pipeline Environment
==========================================

High throughput sequencing technologies generate vast amounts of data that 
require subsequent management, analysis and visualization.

The Grape RNAseq Analysis Pipeline Environment implements a set of workflows 
that allow for easy exploration of RNAseq data. Among other features, it 
enables the users to perform

* quality checks
* read mapping
* eneration of expression and splicing statistics

The results are stored in a MySQL database and become immediately available
through a RESTful back end server that is connected to a web application using 
the Google chart tools for display.
